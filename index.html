                <div class="organizationtext">
                <p>In 1984, the founders of Best Friends made a promise to one another and to the animals alrady in their care that they would build an animal sanctuary in Southern Utah,
                where they could dedicate their lives to housing and finding homes for unwanted pets while advocating the importance of no kill. At that time, shelters across America
                routinely killed cats and dogs as the primary method of pet population control. There wasn't a national voice to end the killing however, as the founders began to broaden
                the reach of Best Friends, they quickly learned that others would stand with them. Over 30 years later, they have inspired others throughout the country to take up the 
                mantle of no kill and have helped to reduce the number of animals being killed in shelters by 91 percent.

            <h1>What the Organization has done so far:</h1>
            <div class="organizationtext1">
            <p>Best Friends was able to save 3.6 million cats and dogs in shelters across the country in 2022 and will lead the United States to no-kill by 2025. According to their 
            data, they had an 81% national save rate of cats and dogs, 57% of U.S. shelters were no-kill, there was a 63% reduction in the number of pets killed since 2016, 3 states,
            Delaware, New Hamshire, and Vermont, were No-Kill in 2022, and 4 states, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, and Rhode Island, had less than 160 cats and dogs to save to reach 
            no-kill.
